This task proved to be one of the most challenging I've encountered so far. Despite my familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it was both time-consuming and demanding, particularly the JavaScript portion. With assistance from the provided documentation, GeeksforGeeks, and various YouTube videos, I was able to complete it. Additionally, I had to learn some JSON along the way.
