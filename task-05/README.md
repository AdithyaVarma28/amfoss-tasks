This task proved to be a challenging task that I have encountered so far. Despite my familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, it was both time consuming and demanding, particularly the JavaScript portion. With help from the provided documentation, GeeksforGeeks, and various YouTube videos, I was able to complete it. Additionally, I had to learn some JSON along the way.
