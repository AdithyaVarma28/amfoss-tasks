## About me

Hey! I’m Adithya Varma from S3 CSE-AI. I love solving puzzles and coding because it’s like a fun challenge for me. When I’m not coding, I’m probably gaming. I’m really into video games, so you might catch me in some battle royale when I’m not working on tech stuff. 

## Why should we choose you?

I think you should choose me for the club because I am a dedicated and consistent coder who enjoys learning new things. I’m always up for trying new challenges and making sure I meet deadlines. I am very interested in contributing to the team and bringing a positive attitude to every project.

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club?

I’m really excited to get involved in the club and contribute however I can. I will help with projects, share what I know and help out with other events. I will also be improving my coding skills and support others.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?

I am really into Machine Learning and enjoy figuring out new algorithms and solving tricky problems. I also like taking on coding challenges to get better. To keep improving, I plan to work on Machine Learning projects and practice coding regularly. This way, I can keep learning and bring new ideas to the club.
