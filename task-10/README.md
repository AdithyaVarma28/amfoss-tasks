# Operation Pixel Merge

The task was relatively easy for me since I had some familiarity with Matlab from my first year. The most time-consuming part was integrating the algorithm I had with the implementation using OpenCV and Pillow. YouTube, GeeksforGeeks, and the provided documentation were very helpful in completing the task. First, I converted each image into an array with each element representing a pixel then checked for the pixel position and color by traversing through the array and using **`OpenCV`**. I drew the line using **`Pillow`** by saving the position and color of previous pixel in global variable.
