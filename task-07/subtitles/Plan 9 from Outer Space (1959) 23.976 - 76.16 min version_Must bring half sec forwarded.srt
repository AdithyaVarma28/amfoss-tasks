1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,400
Criswell Predicts...

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Greetings, my friend. We are
all interested in the future,

3
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,500
for that is where you and I are
going to spend the rest of our lives.

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,900
And remember my friend, future events
such as these will affect you in the future.

5
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:43,700
You are interested in the unknown,
the mysterious, the unexplainable.

6
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,900
That is why you are here.
And now, for the first time,

7
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,900
we are bringing to you the full story
of what happened on that fateful day.

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,400
We are giving you all the evidence,
based only on the secret testimonies

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,100
of the miserable souls who survived

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,200
this terrifying ordeal. The
incidents, the places,

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,200
my friend we cannot keep this a secret
any longer. Let us punish the guilty,

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,900
let us reward the innocent. My friend,

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:24,500
can your heart stand the shocking facts
about grave robbers from outer space?

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Plan 9 From Outer Space

16
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,500
All of us on this earth, know
that there is a time to live,

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,900
and that there is a time to die, yet death
is always a shock to those left behind.

19
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,900
It is even more of a shock,...

19
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,900
...when death, the proud brother,
comes suddenly without warning.

20
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,000
Just at sundown, a small group,

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,700
gathered in silent prayer around
the newly-opened grave

22
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,100
of the beloved wife of an elderly
man. Sundown of the day,

23
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,500
yet also the sundown of the old man's heart,

24
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,000
for the shadows of grief clouded his very reason.

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,500
The funeral over, the saddened group left the graveside.

26
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,700
It was when the gravediggers started their task

27
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,700
that strange things began to take place.

28
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,900
Fifteen to four.

29
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,800
Yup, right on schedule. There's the ol'
San Fernando Valley out there now.

30
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,900
You better radio in for landing instructions, Danny.

31
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Right, Jeff.

32
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Burbank Tower, this is American Flight 812, over.

33
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Wouldn't surprise me any if he's
asleep this time of the morning.

34
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,000
American Flight 812, this is
Burbank Tower. If I were asleep

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
you'd never get on the ground! Your case
maybe you'd be up there for good. Over.

36
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,600
You got me that time, Mac. This
American Flight 812 requesting...

37
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

38
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,700
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

39
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,300
- Holy mackeral.
- Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,

40
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,900
are you in trouble?

41
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,200
- Trouble?
- Take a look for yourself.

42
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,000
- What in the world...
- That's nothing from this world.

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,100
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,
are you in trouble? Are you in trouble?

44
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,900
- Mayday, mayday. Stand by, Burbank Tower.
- Do you suppose the passengers saw it?

45
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,500
I doubt it. Most of them are asleep.
But it was quite a jolt, Jeff. I'll check.

46
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,900
Good. We'll get them ready for landing.
Keep it quiet until we get instructions.

47
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,900
- Right.
- OK. Donny.

47
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,800
American Flight 812
reporting to Burbank Tower, over.

48
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,500
- D'you hear anything?
- I thought I did.

49
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,700
Don't like hearin' noises. 'Specially
when there ain't s'posed to be any.

50
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,900
Yeah, sorta spooky-like.

51
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,000
- Maybe we're getting' old.
- Whatever it is it's gone now.

52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
- That's the best thing for us too. Gone.
- Yeah, let's go.

54
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,100
The grief of his wife's death
became greater and greater agony.

56
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,800
The home they had so long
shared together, became a tomb.

57
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,700
A sweet memory of her joyous living.

58
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,300
The sky to which she had once looked,
was now only a covering for her dead body.

59
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,600
The ever-beautiful flowers she
had planted with her own hand,

60
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,700
became nothing more than
the lost roses of her cheeks.

61
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:04,700
Confused by his great loss, the old man
left that home, never to return again.

63
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:26,300
At the funeral of the old man, unknown to
his mourners, his dead wife was watching.

65
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,200
- First his wife, then he.
- Tragic.

66
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
Tell me something.

67
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,900
Why was his wife buried in the
ground, and he sealed in a crypt?

67
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,800
Something to do with family tradition.
A superstition of some sort.

69
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,000
- Oh!           - Well, it's getting' dark. 
We'd best be on our way.

70
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Then, as two of his mourners left his final resting place.

71
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,400
Minutes later, the police, lead by Inspector
Daniel Clay, arrived at the scene.

73
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,600
- Who found him?
- The man and girl.

74
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
- Medical, uh, examiner been 'round yet?
- Just left.

75
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,900
The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time.

75
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,800
You get their statement?

76
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Yeah, much as we could. They're pretty scared.

77
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,400
Finding a mess like this oughta make anyone frightened.

78
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Have one of the boys take the guy and
the girl back to town. You take charge.

79
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Okay Inspector. What're you gonna do?

80
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,200
- Look around a little.
- Pretty dark out there.

81
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,900
Once you get beyond those lights you won't
be able to see your hand in front of your face.

82
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,500
I will get one of the flashlights from the patrol car.

83
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
- You be careful Clay.
- I'm a big boy now, Johnny.

84
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Looks like a bobcat tore through them.

85
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Yeah.

86
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,200
Say Lieutenant,

87
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,200
- d'you get that funny odour?
- How could I miss it?

88
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,700
Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now.

89
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,400
That's the fifth siren in the last hour.

89
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,100
Oh, something's happened down at the cemetery.

90
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,100
A lot of police cars and lights.
I stopped but I didn't see anything.

91
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh well, whatever it is, the morning
paper will carry the whole story.

92
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,300
You seem to still be up there somewhere.

93
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,700
Maybe I am.

94
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,700
I don't think I've ever seen
you in this mood before.

95
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,400
I guess it's because I've never
been in this mood before.

96
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Something about your flight?

97
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,100
Yeah.

98
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,100
What happened, Jeff?

99
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,700
- I saw a flying saucer.
- A saucer?

100
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,200
- You mean the kind from up there?
- Yeah, or its counterpart.

101
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,600
I was shaped like a huge cigar.
Dan... Edith, saw it too.

102
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,900
When it passed over, the whole compartment
lighted up with a blinding glare.

103
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Then there was a tremendous wind that
practically knocked us off our course.

104
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
- Well did you report it?           - Yeah,
radioed in immediately and they said well

105
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,450
keep it quiet until you land. Then as soon
as we landed, big army brass grabbed us

106
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,600
and made us swear to
secrecy about the whole thing.

107
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,900
Oh, it burns me up. These things have been
seen for years. They're here, it's a fact.

108
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,800
And the public oughta know about it.

108
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
There must be something more you can do about it.

109
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,700
Oh no there isn't.
Oh, but what's the point of making a fuss.

110
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,200
But, last night I saw a flying object that
couldn't possibly have been from this planet.

111
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,400
But I can't say a word. I'm muzzled by army
brass! I can't even admit I saw the thing!

112
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Sounds like Clay's in trouble.

113
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Bet that apparition we saw had
something to do with it.

114
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,800
Come on.

115
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,300
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

116
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,700
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.

117
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,300
S'pose that saucer or whatever it
was had something to do with this?

118
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Your guess is as good as mine, Larry.

119
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,100
But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead...

120
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,600
murdered... and somebody's responsible!

121
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,900
You're in charge now, Lieutenant.

122
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,900
- Yeah, guess I am. Kelton.
- Yes Sir?

123
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,300
Get back up to the car and get on the radio.

123
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,400
Tell the coroner he's gotta make another trip out here.

124
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,000
Well how 'bout the lab boys?

125
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,900
Well who do you think we left back at
the car, boy scouts? Come on, Larry.

126
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Greater love hath no man, than
to lay down his life for another.

127
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,400
It is always difficult to have last words

128
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,400
over the grave of a friend. And
Inspector Daniel Clay was a friend.

129
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,100
A dear friend to me and to all of us.

130
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,700
The bell has rung upon his great career.

131
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:16,950
Now we lay him to rest. A rest
well deserved, but so premature.

132
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,100
People turning south from the freeway
were startled when they saw:

133
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,500
Three flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.

134
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,200


135
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,100
A woman, startled by the sight in
the sky, telephones the police.

136
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:25,200
There comes a time in each man's life,
when he can't even believe his own eyes.

138
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Saucers seen over Hollywood!

139
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Flying saucers seen over Washington D.C.

140
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The army convoy moved into the field.

141
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,400
Rockets were quickly set up.

142
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,100
Colonel Tom Edwards,
in charge of saucer field activities,

143
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,300
was to make the greatest decision of his career.

144
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,990
He made that decision.
Colonel Edwards gave the signal to fire.

145
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,200
Then as swiftly as they had come,
they were gone.

146
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Even to the piercing eye of radar
and the speeding jet fighters.

147
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,700
- Quite a sight, wasn't it Sir.
- A sight I'd rather not be seeing.

148
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,700
- Are you worried about them Sir?
- Well, they must have a reason for their visits.

150
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Visits? Well that would indicate visitors! Are
big guns the usual way of welcoming visitors?

151
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
We haven't always fired at them.

152
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,900
For a time we tried to contact
them by radio, but no response.

153
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Then they attacked a town. A small town,
I'll admit. But nevertheless a town of people.

154
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,600
- People who died.
- I never heard about that Sir.

155
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,900
Well, it was covered up by the
higher echelon. Take any fire,

156
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,800
any earthquake, any major
disaster, then wonder. 

158
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,200
Flying saucers, Captain, are still a rumour.

159
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,100
Officially.

160
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,700
Looks like we beat them off again Sir.

161
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,700
What do they want... where are
they from... where are they going...

162
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,100
They, Sir? Who?

163
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,400
Oh, this is a training manoeuver, Sir. We
only did a little practice firing at the clouds.

164
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Yeah. I wonder what their next move will be.

165
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
What will their next move be?

166
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,700
Your space commander has returned from Earth.

167
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Send him in.

168
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,400
You have your report?

169
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,300
We had to pull in here to
Space Station 7 for regeneration.

170
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,300
We're returning to the planet
Earth immediately thereafter.

171
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,100
- What progress has been made?
- We contacted government officials.

172
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,900
They refuse over existence.

173
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
What plan will you follow now?

174
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,500
Plan 9. It's been absolutely impossible
to work through these Earth creatures.

175
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,700
Their soul is too controlled.

176
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,800
Plan 9... ah yes. Plan 9 deals
with the resurrection of the dead.

178
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,600
Long-distance electrodes shot into the
pinion pituitary glands of recent dead.

179
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,100
- Have you attempted any of this plan as yet?
- Yes Excellency.

180
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,600
How successful has it been?

181
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,600
We have risen two so far.
We shall be just as successful on more.

182
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
The living... they have no suspicion of your movements?

183
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,900
We had to dispose of one policeman.

184
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,300
However, none of those risen have been seen.
At least, not by anyone who still remains alive.

185
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,400
It's too bad it must be handled this way.
But it must.

186
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,200
Those who take from the grave will
lead the way for our other operations.

187
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,000
- Yes, Excellency.
- Continue on. Report to me in two Earth days.

189
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,900
I feared His Excellency wouldn't
take our report this well.

190
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,600
Well had he been dealing with our own people

190
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,100
his reaction would have
been completely different.

191
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,000
He understands the difficulties of the Earth race.

192
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What do you think will be the next obstacle
the Earth people will put in our way?

193
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems.

194
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,600
But those whom we're using cannot think.

194
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,400
They are the dead. Brought to a
simulated life by our electrode guns.

195
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,400
You know, it's an interesting think when you
consider... the Earth people, who can think,

196
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,500
are so frightened by those who cannot: the dead.

197
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Well our ship should be regenerated.
We better get started.

198
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,000
I still think you oughta go in town and
stay with your mother until I get back.

199
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,900
This is our home and nothing's going to take me from it.

200
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,400
Besides, most men try and keep their
wives from going home to Momma.

201
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,800
- That's not the point.
- That's all the point there's going to be.

202
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,600
Now toddle off and fly your flying machine,
Darling. But if you see any more

203
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,500
flying saucers, will you tell them
to pick another house to buzz?

204
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,300
Be Careful. Don't worry about me.

205
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,400
Oh you're the only thing I do worry about.
Oh forget about the flying saucers.

206
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,300
They're up there.
But there's something in that cemetery,

207
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,600
and that's too close for comfort.

208
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,200
The saucers are up there. And the cemetery's out there.

209
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:07,100
But I'll be locked up in there.
Now off to your wild blue yonders.

210
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,400
You promise you'll lock the doors immediately?

211
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,300
I promise. Besides, I'll be in bed
before half an hour is gone,

212
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,600
- with your pillow beside me.
- My pillow?

213
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,300
Well, I have to have something to
keep me company while you're away.

214
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,200
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely,

214
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,400
I reach over and touch it,
then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.

215
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,900
A crazy kid.

216
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I do love you, Darlin'.

217
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,200
- See you Thursday.
- Goodbye, Honey.

218
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,100
You know I'm not leaving here
until you're locked safely inside.

219
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,100
All right, Darling.

220
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,900
If you're especially nice I may even lock the side door.

221
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And be sure you keep the yard lights on.

222
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,300
You're mighty silent this trip, Jeff.

223
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:59,500
- You haven't spoken ten words since takeoff.
- I guess I'm preoccupied, Danny.

225
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,200
We've got thirty-three passengers back
there that have time to be preoccupied.

226
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,100
Flying this flybird doesn't give you that opportunity.

227
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,200
I guess you're right, Danny.

228
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,400
- Paula?
- Yeah.

229
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,900
- There's nothing wrong between you two?
- Oh no, nothing like that.

230
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,100
Just that I'm worried, she being there alone

230
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,500
and those strange things flying over the house and

231
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,500
those incidents in the graveyard the
past few days. It's just got me worried.

232
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Well, I haven't figured out those crazy
skybirds yet but I give you fifty to one odds

233
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
the police have figured out that cemetery thing by now.

234
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,400
- I hope so.        - If you're really that worried
Jeff why don't you radio in and find out?

235
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,100
Mac should be on duty at the field by now. He
could call Paula and relay the message to you.

236
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,400
Hi Edie.

236
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,200
Hi Silents. I haven't heard a word from this
end of the plane since we left the field.

237
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Jeff's been giving me and himself a study in silence.

238
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,000
- You boys are feudin'?
- Oh no Edie, nothing like that.

239
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Hey Edie, how about you and me
balling, it up in Albuquerque?

240
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,800
- Albuquerque? Have you read that flight
schedule Boy?          - What about it?

241
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,000
We land in Albuquerque at 4 am.
That's strictly a nine o'clock town.

242
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,800
Well I know a friend that'll help us...

243
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,500
- Let's have a problem first, huh Danny.
- Ah he's worried about Paula.

244
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
I read about that cemetery business.

244
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,200
I tried to get you kids to not buy
too near one of those things.

244
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,500
We'll get there soon enough for the dears.

245
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,900
He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there.

246
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,900
No doubt about that.
It's quiet alright, like a tomb.

247
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
I'm sorry Jeff, that was a bad joke.

248
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,100
Say., I almost forgot what I came in
here for. How's the coffee situation?

249
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,400
- Mmmm that's for me.
- That sure wouldn't hurt anything, Edie.

250
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,900
Okay, I'll be right back. And say Jeff,
make that call to your wife.

251
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,100
Huh, not only will she throw water on my
Albuquerque...

251
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
...plan but now she's repeating herself.

252
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,600
- How 'bout that Albuquerque ball?
- I can't resist your charm, Danny Boy.

253
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:55,100
Residents near the cemetery paid
little attention to the blast of thunder

254
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
and the flash of lightning.

255
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,500
But from the blast, arose the moving
figure of the dead old man.

256
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Hello? Who?

257
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Mac? Well, hi Mac!

258
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Sure I'm all right.

259
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
I just fell asleep.

260
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Tell Jeff I'm all right.

261
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Okay Mac. Thanks for calling. Goodnight.

262
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Mrs. Trent! Mrs. Trent! What's wrong?

263
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,700
They'll be at the hatch in a moment.
You can open it now, Tanna.

264
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Turn off the electrodes quickly.
They can't tell us from anyone else.

265
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,000
It's tough to find something when you
don't know what you're looking for.

266
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,400
I don't think the Lieutenant does either.

266
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,200
Then what're doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago.

267
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,400
Ah don't ask me any questions.
I'm just a hardhand just like you.

268
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,900
What do you suppose that noise was?

269
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,800
Whatever it was it's no more strange than the
other things happening around this cemetery.

270
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,200
Spirits like Old Farmer Caulder talked about.

271
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,800
- Heh. Maybe.        - The only spirits he saw
tonight were those I smelled on his breath.

272
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,600
Well don't forget Mrs. Trent claims to have seen them too.

272
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,300
She didn't have anything on her breath.

273
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,700
- She was hysterical.       - Well true, she
was frightened, and in a state of shock.

274
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,300
But, don't forget that torn
nightgown and the scratched feet.

275
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:18,200
Yeah I hadn't thought of that. I guess
that's why you're a detective lieutenant

276
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,400
and I'm still a uniformed cop.

277
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,800
Sometimes it's only the breaks, Larry.
In the meantime let's get...

278
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,200
- Lieutenant, Lieutenant! Did you hear that?
- How could we help it?

279
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,600
- It sure was strange.
- Know what it was?

280
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,500
No more than you do.

280
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
If it weren't for orders I'd get out of here right now.

281
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,500
- It was a saucer.
- A flying saucer? What makes you say that?

282
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,700
You remember the noise we heard the other night?

283
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,300
We were knocked to the ground, how could I forget?

284
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Exactly, but you're not remembering that sound.

285
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,300
There you're wrong, Lieutenant.

285
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,700
I'm with a fact the sound is similar,
but what about the blinding light?

286
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,700
Well haven't you heard?
Many times a saucer hasn't had a glow,

287
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,800
- or a light of any kind for that matter.
- That proves it. What next Lietenant?

288
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,200
Oh, Lietenant, Maybe this
doesn't mean much, but...

288
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,800
...uh Jamie and me found a grave
that looks like it's been busting into.

289
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,000
- What? Where?
- Why uh why...

290
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,800
Come on man out with it,
we haven't got all day to waste.

291
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,300
- Uh, just over there beyond the crypt.
- All right, show us the way!

292
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,600
Look, here it is Lieutenant.

293
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,400
Ah it's been broken into all right.

294
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,100
Strange. If someone had broken in, the
dirt should be piled up here somewhere.

295
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,900
It looks like it's fallen in into the grave.

295
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,300
Larry you'll be out of that
uniform before you know it.

296
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,500
- Do we have the right to look down there
Lieutenant?         - Ah, technically no.

297
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Well, this spot looks familiar, though.

297
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,300
We shouldn't investigate any further
without the permission of next of kin.

298
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,100
Let's go get it!

299
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,100
- How?      - I see what you mean,
the gravestone's down there.

300
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,900
Well, let's go down and find out who's grave it is.

301
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,700
- How?
- By going down and finding out!

302
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,200
- Are you sure you mean that Lieutenant?
- If I didn't mean it I wouldn't have said it.

303
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,800
- Scared?       - Well, why do I always get
hooked up with these spook details?

304
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Monsters, graves, bodies,...

305
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
oooh all right.

306
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,500
Casket's here, but nobody's in it.

307
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,300
Can you read the name on the casket?

308
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,600
It's too dark. Give me a flashlight.

309
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,600
- How 'bout a match?
- We sure could try it. Let me have them!

310
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,700
It's Inspector Clay's grave!
Be he ain't in it!

311
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,600
But meanwhile, in the Pentagon, in Washington DC...

312
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,200
Try G2...

313
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,800
...come in!

314
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Yes of course, I'll keep in touch.

315
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:22,100
Come in, Colonel Edwards.
Close the door. At ease, Colonel.

316
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,900
- Thank you, Sir.
- Sit down.

317
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,600
I... understand, Colonel, you've been
on tap for many of our saucer attacks.

318
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm in charge of field operations, Sir.

319
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,500
You believe there are such
things as flying saucers, Colonel?

320
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
- Yes Sir.
- You've seen them?

321
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,300
Yes Sir.

322
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,900
You realize there's a government directive
stating that there is...

322
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,900
...no such thing as a flying saucer?

323
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,900
Yes Sir.

324
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,200
Do you stand by your statement
that you've seen flying saucers?

325
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,600
Well, uh...

326
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,400
Yes Sir.

327
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,400
This could mean a court marshall.
Admitting this against direct orders.

328
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,900
General Roberts, may I speak freely?

329
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,900
- You may.        
- How could I hope to hold down my command

330
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,900
if I didn't believe in what I saw and shot at?

331
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,900
- I, uh, like you Colonel.
- Thank you, Sir.

332
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,000
There are flying saucers.

333
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
There's no doubt they are in our skies.
They've been there for some time.

334
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,700
What're we going to do about them?

335
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,400
- Who knows?
- Then, uh, they really are there?

336
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,400
- I thought you were convinced of that!
- I am.

337
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,800
We've had contact with them.

338
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,700
- Contact? How?
- Radio.

339
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,800
- They speak our language?
- Well not quite.

340
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,800
We received messages from their space ships.

340
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,200
For a while it came in as
just a lot of jumbled noise.

341
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,000
And now, Sir?

342
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,900
Well since they first uh tried
contact with us by radio,

342
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,900
we've developed a language computer.

343
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,800
A machine that breaks down any language to our own.

344
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,600
General, uh, what's this all got to do with me?

345
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,300
Well you've been in charge of
saucer field activity for a long while.

346
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,700
I think it's about time you heard
these recordings. Do you mind?

347
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,200
Mind? Huh, I'm anxious!

348
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,400
This is Eros, a space soldier
from a planet of your galaxy.

349
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:44,600
I fully realize our language differences,
however I also know you finally have

350
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,800
perfected the dictorobitary, or as you on
Earth put it, the language computer.

350
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,800
So you can now understand that which I speak.

351
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,500
Since the beginning of your time,
we have been far beyond your planet.

352
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:03,300
It has taken you centuries to even grasp
what we developed eons of your years ago.

352
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,300

353
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,000
Do you still believe it impossible we exist?

353
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,700
You didn't actually think you were the
only inhabited planet in the universe?

354
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,400
How can any race be so stupid?

355
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,200
Permit me to set your mind at ease. We do
not want to conquer your planet. Only save it.

356
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,200
We could have destroyed it long ago,
if that had been our aim.

357
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,800
Our principal purpose is friendly.

357
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,000
I admit, we have had to take certain means
which you might refer to as criminal,

359
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,800
but that is because of your big guns which
have destroyed some of our representatives.

360
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,500
If you persist in denying us our landings,

360
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,200
then we must only accept that you
do not want us on friendly terms.

361
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:53,400
We then have no alternative but to
destroy you before you destroy us.

362
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,700
With your ancient, juvenile minds, you
have developed explosives too fast...

362
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,000
...for your minds to conceive
what you were doing.

363
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,300
You are on the verge of destroying the entire universe.

364
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,600
We are part of that universe.

365
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
This is our last...

366
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,900
That's the end of that one.

366
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,100
Atmospheric conditions in outer space
often interfere with transmitting.

367
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,300
How many of these recordings do you have General?

368
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:27,000
An even dozen up to now. This was the
last one. We received it over a month ago.

369
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,600
- Do you think they mean business?
- We can't afford to take any chances.

370
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,800
Come over here.

370
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,400
You ever been to Hollywood?

371
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,400
- Oh a couple of times. A few years ago.
- You're going to be there in the morning.

372
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,400
Just a few minutes from Hollywood, in the
town of San Fernando, reports have come in

373
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,400
of saucers flying so low the exhaust
knocked people to the ground.

374
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,200
There have even been stated claims of saucer landings.

375
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,400
Major Carlson will replace you while you're out there.

376
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,700
You're the best man for the job
of attempting to contact them.

377
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,500
Find them, Colonel. See what in hell it is they want!

378
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,900
All right, Sir.

379
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,000
These are confidential reports, Colonel.
Read them over carefully on the plane,

380
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,900
turn them over to intelligence
when you get to Los Angeles.

380
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,800
- They'll have further orders for disposition.
- Yes Sir.

382
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,000
- Colonel Edwards?
- Yes Sir?

383
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Sir.

384
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,000
We are ready to report, Excellency.

385
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
- You are many days late.
- It was unavoidable.

386
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,500
We tried to transmit via televisor,

386
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,200
but atmospheric conditions
made transmission impossible.

387
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,200
You should have transmitted
as soon as conditions permitted.

387
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,200
I thought time was of the essence.

388
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,800
Suspicion has fallen upon our movements.

388
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,800
Our ships have been viewed
near the point of operations.

389
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,000
And what has this extra time gained, Eros?

390
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
We have successfully risen three of the dead ones.

391
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,300
- Permit me to see one.
- Bring in the big one.

392
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,100
Use your small electrode gun.

393
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,300
I have taken two ships from your command.

394
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,800
But... that will leave only my ship!

395
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,800
It is necessary that you continue your mission alone.

396
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,700
I have need of your other ships elsewhere.

397
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:57,700
Even though you have risen three of the
Earth dead, the plan is far from successful,

398
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,600
and you Eros, must prove it an
operational success before more time,

399
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,500
energy, and ships, may be spent on it.

400
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,800
We will not fail. Everything is on our side.

401
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,800
Not everything!
You do not have the live Earth people!

402
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,700
You report that your ship was viewed
at scene of your present operations?

403
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,400
That is correct.

404
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,400
They have been viewed many times,
but not at the scene of operations.

405
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,100
Something must be done about that.

406
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,900
Stop him Tanna! He's close enough!
Turn off your electrode gun!

407
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:49,900
No! No! Stop him Tanna!

408
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,600
- I can't get it, it's jammed!
- Stop him you fool!

409
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,600
Drop the gun to the floor, Tanna!
The metal will break contact!

410
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,600
That was too close!

411
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,600
Yes.

412
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,900
Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him.

413
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,500
Yes, he's a fine specimen.
Are they all this powerful on planet Earth?

414
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,300
This one is an exception, Excellency.

415
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,300
- What are the other two like?
- One is a woman, the other an old man.

416
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,300
- An old man, you say?
- Yes, Excellency.

417
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,000
This gives me a plan. Put the big one away.

418
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Pick up your electrode gun. Make sure it's
in working order before pointing it at him.

419
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,200
Whatever made it jam must
have been cleared by the fall.

420
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,400
Take him back to the ship.

421
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:20,700
The old one must be sacrificed. Re-land on
Earth. Send the old one to enter a dwelling.

422
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,600
Then cut off the electrokinetic and
turn on your ship's decomposure ray.

423
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,900
The result will astound those watching. 

423
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,500
Astound them enough to delay
their attention until you have...

423
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,000
gained your other recruits from the cemetery.

424
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,400
Yes, Excellency. It'll be done.

425
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,900
Report to me when this has been accomplished.

426
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,700
Eros, the Earth people are
getting to that which we fear.

427
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,600
Since they will not listen or respect our existence,

428
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,900
they cannot help but believe our powers when
they see their own dead walking 'round again,

429
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,400
brought about by our advancement in such things.

429
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,900
As soon as you have enough
of the dead recruits,...

430
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,400
...march them on the capitals of the
Earth, let nothing stand in your way.

430
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,900
Their own dead will be used to make them
accept our existence, and believe in that fact.

431
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,000
Mr. and Mrs. Trent... this is Colonel
Edwards from Washington DC.

432
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,900
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Hello Colonel.

433
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,100
Colonel would like to ask you a few questions.

434
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,100
- Questions? What about, Colonel?
- May I, uh, sit down?

435
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,000
Oh, I'm sorry, please do.

436
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I want to ask you about your strange
experience the other night,

436
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
when you saw the flying saucer.

437
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,200
After that the police brought me home.

438
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,600
I hope I never see such a sight again.

439
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,000
Well after your description I don't
think I'd want to see it either.

440
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,500
One thing more... after you were forced
to the ground by that blast of wind,

441
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,800
- was it a hot or cold blast?
- It's kind of hard to explain.

442
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,900
It wasn't hot, wasn't cold, it was just a terrific
force. We-we couldn't get off the ground.

443
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,200
The light blinded me so badly I couldn't see a thing.

444
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:59,100
We could only feel the pressure of the wind,
until it was gone. When the glare left us,

445
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,100
we could see a glowing ball
disappearing off in the distance.

446
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,700
- Which way?
- Toward the cemetery.

447
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,100
This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard.

448
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,000
And every word of it's true, too.

449
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,400
That's the fantastic part of it.

450
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,400
We found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery.

451
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,200
Then again, didn't find anything
to base a fact or suspicion on.

452
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,200
Hey, do you hear anything.

453
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,600
You see anything out there Kelton?

454
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,000
Too dark, Lieutenant.

455
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,400
But something's started stinking awful bad.

456
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,900
There's something out there.

457
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:41,300
- What do you make of that?     - Wish if got
me! It didn't look that way a minute ago.

458
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,300
- What about your man?     - Oh, in the
excitement I forgot all about Kelton.

459
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,800
Oh, he'll be all right in a few minutes.

460
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,200
- Did you see that thing? Did you get it?
- We got it.

461
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,100
What was it? It didn't fall... I fired every bullet I had.

462
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:09,600
So did I. I don't know what it was or
what happened, but unless that bag of bones

462
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:09,600

463
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,200
can reassemble itself, it's out of the running now.

464
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,100
Colonel I've been out here so often you'd
think I'd taken a lease on this place.

465
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,000
- Not a long lease, I hope.
- I see what you mean. 

466
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,900
But you know, I can't help but feel
the answer's out here somewhere.

467
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,000
Is the uh girl safe?

468
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,900
- Mrs. Trent you'd better stay with the car.
- Stay here alone? Not on your life.

469
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:48,000
- Modern women...        - Yeah, they been
that way all down through the ages.

470
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,700
Especially in a spot like this.

471
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,800
- Kelton!          - Yes Sir?
- Stay with Mrs. Trent.

472
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,800
All right, Lieutenant.

473
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,200
- Now you stay close to the officer, Honey.
- I'd feel safer with you.

474
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,400
Now the Lieutenant knows best.

474
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,100
Oh I don't like it, but I guess
there isn't much I can do about it.

475
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,300
- You have a gun?
- No.

476
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,300
Know how to use one?

477
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,900
After four years in the Marine Corps?

478
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,100
- Here.
- You think we'll need these?

479
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,600
You can never tell. Let's get going.

480
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,700
What do you expect to find out here?

480
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,900
Well there's only one answer to that Mr. Trent,

481
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,100
We'll know when we find it.
Inspector Clay's grave is right over here.

482
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:59,400
- Is that the one you told me
was broken into?       - Yes.

483
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,400
- This it?
- Yeah.

484
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,100
Looks to me like someone had broken out instead of in.

485
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,000
I figured that, but that's impossible!

485
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Look, Colonel, some things just can't happen.

486
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:31,900
Yeah well after that apparition that
was draped across Mr. Trent's patio,

486
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,300
I would say we should keep
our minds open to anything.

487
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:39,800
Look, Colonel, I'm a policeman. I've got to deal in facts.

488
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,400
But, I guess I'll have to go along with you.

488
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,000
You know I bet my badge right now we
haven't seen the last of those weirdies.

489
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,700
- They'll discover our ship soon.
- You going to let them find us?

490
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,800
It's the only way. These are the same
men who have been so close so often.

491
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,600
They must be halted before
they can inform others about us.

492
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,600
- But there were others in the car!
- They'll be taken too.

493
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,000
Send the big one to get
the girl and the policeman.

493
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,900
I'll turn on the dictorobitary
so we may converse with them.

494
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,000
You know, maybe we're barking up the wrong tree.

495
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
One thing a policeman learns, Mr. Trent, is patience.

496
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
- Where the burn spot you mentioned.
- Right over the, look!

497
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,100
We'll investigate, but move carefully.

498
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,900
A moment or two more,
and you will be the first live Earth people

499
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,100
ever to enter a celestial ship.

500
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:06,500
Wow... boy, how could anything
that big hide for so long a time?

501
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,800
Never heard metal sound like that before.

502
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:15,500
- What do you see?       - Only my reflection.
Must be some kind of one-way glass.

503
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,900
- How do you get into this thing?
- I'm not sure I want to find out.

504
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,900
They're just outside.

505
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,400
You can open the outer hatch now.

506
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,500
- You goin' in that thing?
- That's what we're here for.

507
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,800
I don't know, the way these things speed
around we might just get in there...

507
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,200
- ...and pft! Off it goes.
- That's a chance we take.

508
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,800
Well, I took a chance on those earlier airplanes.

508
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,500
Might just as well see what the inside of one
of these looks like. Got your guns ready?

509
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,900
I tell you one thing, if a little
green man jumps out at me...

509
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,500
I'm shooting first and asking questions later.

510
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,200
They're in the outer chamber now.

511
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,200
Eros, do we have to kill them?

512
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,600
- Yes.
- It seems such a waste.

513
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,900
Well wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than,

513
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:47,500
with their meddling, permit them
to destroy the entire universe?

514
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,500
- You're always right, Eros.
- Of course.

515
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,500
But those are not my words,
those are the words of the Ruler.

516
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,500
Now you two stay right where you're at.

517
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,000
We will do as you command. For the moment.

517
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,800
No for the moment about it.
You just do as I tell you.

518
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,000
- You do not need guns.
- Maybe we think we do.

519
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,900
They would be of no use to you now.

519
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,300
They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood,

520
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,100
and you two look like you've got a lot of both.

521
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,200
True, they would be effective upon us.

521
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,300
If you were to have the opportunity to use them...

522
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,200
Mister, if you don't get away from that control...

522
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,900
...board I'll show you just how effective they can be.

523
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,900
Shall we talk now, or wait?
Your friends will be here shortly.

524
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,500
- What friends?
- Those you left at the vehicle.

525
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,500
- If you've done anything to Paula...
- Take it easy Mr. Trent.

526
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Oh I assure you, no harm has come to her.
Would you like to see?

527
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,200
Next time you try that I won't aim at the board.

527
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,000
You're a headstrong young man.

528
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,600
I was only going to turn on the televisor
so you could see her movements.

529
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:26,300
Go ahead, my friend, but move very carefully.

530
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,500
She's only fainted.

531
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:52,000
- You fiend!
- I...? A fiend? I am a soldier of our planet!

533
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:59,500
I...? A fiend? We did not come here as enemies.

534
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:04,900
We came only with friendly intentions.
To talk. To ask your aid.


536
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,500
- Our aid?
- Yes.

537
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,500
Your aid for the whole universe.

537
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,900
But your governments of Earth
refused even to accept our existence.

538
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:20,900
Even though you've seen us, heard our
messages, you still refused to accept us.

539
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,900
Why is it so important that you want to
contact the governments of our Earth?

540
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:30,100
Because of death. Because all you of Earth are idiots!

541
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,200
- Now you just hold on, Buster.
- No you hold on.

542
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:39,900
First was your firecracker, a harmless
explosive. Then your handgrenade.

543
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:46,800
They began to kill your own people a few
at a time. Then the bomb, then a larger bomb.

544
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,100
Many people are killed at one time.

545
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:55,600
Then your scientists stumbled upon
the atom bomb. Split the atom.

546
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,500
Then the hydrogen bomb,
where you actually explode the air itself.

547
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:07,700
Now you brings the destruction
of the entire universe, served by our sun.

548
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,900
The only explosion left is the solaronite.

549
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,600
- Why there's no such thing.
- Perhaps to you.

550
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,900
But we've known it for centuries.

550
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,800
Your scientists will stumble upon
it as they have all the others.

551
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:30,000
But the juvenile minds you possess will not
comprehend its strength, until it's too late.

552
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,800
You're way above our heads.

553
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:37,500
The solaronite is a way to explode
the actual particles of sunlight.

554
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,700
Why that's impossible.

555
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,700
Even now, your scientists are working
on a way to harness the sun's rays.

556
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,000
The rays of sunlight are minute particles.

557
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Is it so far from your imagination
they cannot do as I have suggested?

558
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,300
Why a particle of sunlight can't
even be seen or measured.

559
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:58,800
Can you see or measure an atom?
Yet you can explode one.

560
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:02,100
A ray of sunlight is made up many atoms.

561
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,200
So what if we do developed this solaronite bomb?

561
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,200
We'd be even a stronger nation than now.

562
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:12,700
Stronger. You see? You see?
Your stupid minds... stupid! Stupid!

563
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,900
- That's all I'm taking from you!
- Get back here you jerk!

564
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,700
Let him finish.

565
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,000
It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.

566
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,800
Headstrong, violent! No use of the mind God gave you.

567
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,500
You talk of God?

568
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,500
You also think it impossible that we, too,
might think of God?

569
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:51,500
You, who wear the uniform of your country.
You see, I wear the uniform of my country.

570
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:58,600
Yes, we've had to use drastic means to
get to you, but you left us no alternative.

571
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:06,200
When you have the solaronite,
you have nothing. Nor, does the universe.

572
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:11,000
You speak of solaronite, but just what is it?

573
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:18,400
Take a can of your gasoline.
Say this can of gasoline is the sun.

574
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,600
Now you spread a thin a line of it to a ball,
representing the Earth.

575
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight,
the sun particles.

576
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:35,700
Here we saturate the ball with
the gasoline, the sunlight.

577
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame
will speedily travel around the Earth,

578
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
back along the line of gasoline to can,

579
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,900
or the sun itself. It will explode this source,

579
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:52,900
and spread to every place that
gasoline, or sunlight, touches.

580
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:59,600
Explode the sunlight here, Gentlemen,
and you explode the universe.

581
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:07,100
Explode the sunlight here, and a chain
reaction will occur, direct to the sun itself.

582
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,900
And to all the planets that sunlight touches.

583
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:17,000
To every planet in the universe.
This why you must be stopped.

584
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
This is why any means must be used to stop you.

585
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:27,300
In a friendly manner, or as it seems, you want it.

586
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:33,100
- He's mad.      - Mad? Is it mad that you
destroy other people to save yourselves?

587
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,200
You have done this.

588
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,200
Is it mad that one country must
destroy another to save themselves?

589
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,700
You have also done this.
How then is it mad that one planet...

590
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:48,100
- ...must destroy another that threatens
the very existence...      - That's enough!

591
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:55,500
In my land, women are for advancing
the race, not for fighting man's battles.

592
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,400
Life is not so expansive on my planet.

593
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:05,600
We don't cling to it like you do. Our entire
aim is for the development of our planet.

594
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,300
- What happened to you?
- How come you're all alone?

595
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:30,300
- I asked for lots of help!     - You sounded
drunk or something on the radio.

596
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,300
- If I didn't see it with my own eyes I would
never have believed it!     - Believed what?

597
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,800
It was horrible! And he almost broke my shoulder!

598
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,500
Look, what are you trying to
say? If you don't make sense...

598
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,300
...we'll never get to the bottom
of this. Now who slugged you?

599
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,300
Inspector Clay.

600
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:49,300
- What?         - It was Clay all right,
only not like we remembered him.

601
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,400
Well his grave was busted into, wasn't it?

602
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,600
Next you'll tell me you saw skeletons.

603
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,600
- We did, earlier.
- Now I know you're off your rocker.

604
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,100
All of us saw, the Lieutenant, the Colonel, everybody!

605
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,900
- Where's the Lieutenant now?
- We've gotta find them.

606
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,400
Mrs. Trent is gone! 

606
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,700
I was left here to guard her. Then Clay
showed up and put me out of the running.

607
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,500
And the second time tonight and
I'm getting darned tired of it!

608
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,400
- Which way were they going?
- Oh, that way.

609
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:16,900
Come on!

610
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:29,600
Then one day it could all be gone, 
in one big puff of smoke...

611
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:40,600
...and ball of fire. All that out there, the
stars, the planets, all just an empty void.

614
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,300
You two had better come along with us.

615
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,300
- Come with you? Where?
- The police station.

616
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,800
So it seems you think you have the upper hand.

617
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,900
Look out that window.

618
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,200
Jeff.

619
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:16,900
She is unharmed, but he would
kill in seconds if I so choose.

620
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,900
Holy cow!

621
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Look there.

622
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:45,400
- It's Clay all right, there's no mistaking
that.        - And he's got Mrs. Trent!

623
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,400
- Get your gun ready.     - From all I've
seen tonight guns won't do any good.

624
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:54,400
Clay is dead, and we buried him. How are we
going to kill somebody that's already dead?

625
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:00,100
Dead! And yet there he stands! That other
one earlier I emptied a full clip into him.

626
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:04,300
I'm seeing it, that's the only reason I'm listening to you.

627
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,500
Look, I've got an idea. Hurt him or
not, we've got to try something.

628
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,700
I'm going to sneak up behind him
and whop him over the head.

628
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,000
That oughta make him move.

629
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:20,100
Follow me. Even when Clay was alive he
couldn't run fast enough to catch me,

630
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,700
so when he does, you grab Mrs. Trent and
run like lightning in the opposite direction.

631
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:28,200
- Oh, you think it will work?
- Know anything else to try?

632
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:50,800
Oh, I'll be all right. Take care of the others.

633
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,900
Your men have felled the big one.

634
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:58,600
This could only happen because the electrode ray is off.

635
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,600
He'll walk again when I turn it on.

636
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,300
Hold it, right there.

637
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,200
Suppose the Lieutenant and
the others are in that thing!

637
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,000
Well suppose there are martians
or something in there!

638
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:17,700
Come on, let's go.

639
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,300
Open up in there, open up!

640
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,200
- Get that door open.       - Colonel I
wouldn't know one switch from another.

641
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,400
Hold on Eros, I'll have the ship in the air in a minute!

642
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,300
Get out of here, Jeff! The ship's on fire!

643
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,600
Eros!

644
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,100
Eros everything's on fire! Hurry, wake up
Eros!  Eros, Eros, wake up, wake up!

645
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:50,700
Eros! Eros wake up, Eros! God wake up!

646
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,100
Oh, I wonder if that's the last we'll see of them?

647
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,000
Perhaps, but sooner or later there'll be other.

648
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Look!

649
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,800
Have they caught that woman, that thing yet?

650
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,300
Hey that's right, there's another ghoul running loose.

651
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,700
And it's my guess that she'll look like him.

652
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,700
With the ship and the ray gun
gone, they have no control.

653
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:38,600
We got to hand it to them though,
they're far ahead from us.

654
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,200
Fire! Eros! Aaaaaaaaah!

655
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:58,600
My friend, you have seen this
incident based on sworn testimony.

656
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,500
Can you prove that it didn't happen?

657
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:06,500
Perhaps on your way home,
someone will pass you in the dark,

658
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:10,900
and you will never know it, for
they will be from outer space.

659
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:16,100
Many scientists believe that another
world is watching us this moment.

660
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,000
We once laughed at the horseless carriage,

661
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,600
the aeroplane, the telephone,
the electric light, vitamins,

662
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,700
radio, and even television!

663
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,700
And now some of us laugh at outer space.

664
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,600
God help us... in the future.

665
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:16,600
