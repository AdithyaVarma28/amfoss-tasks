1
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:29,095
Criswell (Narrator) was born
Jeron King Criswell...

2
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,183
...on August 18, 1907.

3
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:39,689
Criswell was a friend of Ed Wood's
and was in two more of Ed's movies:

4
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:46,154
"Night of the Ghouls" (1959)
again as narrator...

5
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:52,244
...and "Orgy of the Dead" (1965)
as the Lord of the Dead.

6
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:59,709
A popular prognosticator of the day
in 1969 he wrote a book:

7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:05,800
"Criswell Predicts:
From Now To The Year 2000!"

8
00:01:06,717 --> 00:01:12,807
Among his predictions was that
the world would end in 1999.

9
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:19,814
Criswell passed away on
October 4, 1982.

10
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:29,824
"Grave Robbers From Outer Space"
was the original title for "Plan 9."

11
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:37,205
It was changed
apparently at the insistence...

12
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:43,254
...of the Baptists who were
financing the picture.

13
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:50,845
Principal photography on "Plan 9"
took place in August 1956.

14
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:57,852
The film was completed (and
apparently previewed) in that year.

15
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:05,191
After more than two years
producer J. Edward Reynolds...

16
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:11,781
...eager to recover the costs
he had incurred from production...

17
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:17,872
...bought the rights to "Plan 9"
from Ed for one dollar.

18
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:25,211
When Reynolds finally found
a distributor...

19
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:31,302
...they required him to pay
all distribution costs himself.

20
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:38,309
But he finally got the film
released in July 1959.

21
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:48,276
Bela Lugosi was born
Béla Ferenc Dezso Blasko...

22
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:51,197
...on October 20, 1882.

23
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:58,287
He is credited in "Plan 9" as
"Ghoul Man."

24
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:05,835
The script however referred to him
as the "Dracula character"...

25
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:11,926
...and the film itself only calls him
"the old man."

26
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:18,933
Lugosi's career began in
Hungarian films in 1917.

27
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:26,272
It ended with "Plan 9" in 1959
despite his having died...

28
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:29,360
...on August 16, 1956.

29
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:23,998
On the right is our hero Jeff Trent,
played by Gregory Walcott.

30
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:31,005
Walcott was born Bernard Mattox
on January 13, 1928.

31
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:38,344
When "Plan 9" was made he had
already appeared on television...

32
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,432
...and made several movies.

33
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:46,020
"Plan 9" didn't hurt his career much.

34
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:53,027
He would work steadily
for the next two decades.

35
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:59,992
Walcott is known for heavily
disparaging "Plan 9" over the years.

36
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:07,332
This didn't stop him accepting
the part of a prospective investor...

37
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:13,422
...in Tim Burton's 1994
biopic "Ed Wood."

38
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:21,346
David De Mering (Danny) appeared
in one more film for Ed...

39
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:24,433
..."Night of the Ghouls" (1959).

40
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:04,389
The gravediggers are played by
two of the producers of "Plan 9":

41
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:11,020
Associate Producer Hugh Thomas Jr.
In the darker clothes...

42
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:17,069
...and Executive Producer
J. Edward Reynolds in the lighter.

43
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:24,409
Reynolds was Ed's landlord and had
secured the financing for "Plan"

44
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,496
...through his local church.

45
00:06:55,482 --> 00:07:01,864
The footage of Bela Lugosi
that appears in "Plan"

46
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:08,120
...wasn't shot for
anything in particular.

47
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:15,127
It was basically Ed and Bela
improvising for the camera.

48
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:19,464
This footage was shot...

49
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:25,554
...at the home of fellow
Ed regular Tor Johnson.

50
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:33,102
Additional Bela footage existed
that Ed hoped to use...

51
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:39,193
...for another film:
"The Ghoul On The Moon."

52
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,532
When Ed went to retrieve
the footage, however...

53
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:52,623
...he found it had deteriorated,
so the film was not made.

54
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:32,246
The mourners are played by
Ben Frommer and Gloria Dea.

55
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:39,253
Frommer also appeared in Ed's
"Bride of the Monster“ (1955)."

56
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:46,592
Frommer was born on
June 12, 1913...

57
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:52,391
...and died on May 9, 1992,
having spent 40 years in showbiz.

58
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:36,685
Tor Johnson (Inspector Clay) was born
Tore Johansson on October 19, 1903.

59
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:43,692
He was a pro wrestler working
as "The Super Swedish Angel."

60
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:51,324
He also appeared for Ed
as the giant Lobo

61
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:58,247
in both "Bride of the Monster"
and "Night of the Ghouls."

62
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:04,670
Tor made many other films besides
the ones he did with Ed...

63
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:11,260
...including the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby
picture "Road to Rio" (1947)

64
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:17,351
and Hope's 1951 comedy
"The Lemon Drop Kid."

65
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:24,690
In "Ed Wood" (1994) Tor is
portrayed by another pro wrestler...

66
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,778
...George "The Animal" Steele.

67
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:44,378
Hopefully you enjoyed Tor's
dialogue from the previous scene.

68
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:51,385
They were the only words he ever
spoke in an Ed Wood film.

69
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:58,724
For the rest of "Plan 9" and in
his other Ed movies...

70
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,770
...Tor is completely mute.

71
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,774
Tor passed away on May 12, 1971.

72
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:37,431
Jeff's wife Paula Trent
is played by Mona McKinnon.

73
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:44,438
Mona met Ed when she went to
an open audition with Dolores Fuller.

74
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:51,445
Dolores wound up as Ed's girlfriend
and starred in several of his films.

75
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:58,452
Mona also worked with Ed
on other projects besides "Plan 9."

76
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:05,791
She appeared in a supporting role
in 1954's "Jail Bait"...

77
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:12,381
...and in footage shot
for the unfinished "Hellborn"...

78
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:18,472
that was incorporated into
"Night of the Ghouls."

79
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:39,910
Ed uses a classic 1950s description
of UFOs: "cigar-shaped."

80
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:47,875
This description usually came
from airline pilots

81
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:53,924
who would be seeing the UFO
from the side.

82
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,970
Coming up is one of the most
infamous moments in "Plan 9."

83
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:47,893
To the right you can see
the famous cardboard gravestone

84
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,981
knocked over by an extra's feet.

85
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:39,528
Standing in for Bela in this scene
(and for most of the film)

86
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:45,619
is Dr. Thomas Mason,
a chiropractor.

87
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:52,958
Mason would appear in
and co-finance Ed's next film...

88
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,046
..."Night of the Ghouls."

89
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:48,682
Duke Moore (Lieutenant Daniel Harper)
was born James Moore on July 15, 1913.

90
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:55,689
Moore was an old friend of Ed's
from their community theater days.

91
00:15:56,606 --> 00:16:02,654
He first worked with Ed on TV
commercials in the late 1940s.

92
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:09,661
He would go on to appear
in six of Ed's films...

93
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:16,668
the last, "Take It Out In Trade,"
in 1970.

94
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:23,717
Moore passed away on
November 16, 1976.

95
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:53,078
The reverend is portrayed by
Reverend Lynn Lemon...

96
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:59,127
...the pastor at producer
J. Edward Reynolds' church.

97
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:07,051
To help secure the financing Ed was
baptized into Lemon's church...

98
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:13,141
...and used to call Lemon for
advice for years afterward.

99
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:34,788
Much has been written about
the flying saucers in "Plan 9."

100
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:42,127
Many have claimed that Ed used
anything from paper plates...

101
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,173
...to hubcaps to create them.

102
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:37,141
In the 1992 documentary
"Flying Saucers Over Hollywood"...

103
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:43,231
...it is demonstrated that they were
in fact store-bought model kits.

104
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:10,132
Tom Keene (Col. Tom Edwards) was born
George Duryea on December 30, 1896...

105
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:13,219
...in Rochester, New York.

106
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:21,185
Keene was a favorite of Ed's and
appeared in two other Ed projects:

107
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:27,609
1951's "The Sun Was Setting"
and the 1953 television pilot...

108
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:33,865
..."Crossroad Avenger:
The Adventures of the Tucson Kid."

109
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:41,205
Keene appeared in over
100 films and television shows...

110
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:44,292
...(mostly westerns).

111
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:51,299
"Plan 9" was Keene's last film.

112
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:58,932
He passed away on
August 4, 1963.

113
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:10,979
John "Bunny" Breckinridge (The Ruler)
was born John Cabell Breckinridge...

114
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,067
...on August 6, 1903.

115
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:21,406
He was a descendant of U.S.
Vice President John Breckinridge...

116
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:27,996
...who served under
President James Buchanan...

117
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:33,586
...and was a Confederate leader
during the Civil War.

118
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:41,426
"Bunny" had intended to undergo
a sex-change operation...

119
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:47,517
...but an auto accident prevented
him from having the procedure.

120
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:51,521
He died on November 5, 1996.

121
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,569
He was portrayed by actor
Bill Murray in "Ed Wood."

122
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:45,575
Dudley Manlove (Eros)
was a longtime friend of Ed's.

123
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:53,123
He also appeared in Ed's
"Final Curtain"...

124
00:23:53,124 --> 00:24:00,047
and some of Ed's industrial films
for Autonetics Aviation in the 1960s.

125
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:06,470
Never a major success in film
or television...

126
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:09,557
...Manlove had great success on radio.

127
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:16,564
He passed away on April 17, 1996.

128
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:22,273
Pillow hugging is a common
reaction to feelings of loneliness.

129
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:29,613
In Japan the phenomenon has
spawned products such as...

130
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:36,244
...dakimakura "hugging pillows"
(life-size pillows with images of...

131
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:42,667
...female anime or video game
characters printed on them)...

132
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:49,257
...and the "Romantic Pillow"
available in either "boyfriend"...

133
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:55,348
...or "girlfriend" form
with a built-in arm for cuddling.

134
00:26:56,265 --> 00:27:02,646
Pillow hugging is also
used in aromatherapy...

135
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:08,694
...with scented pillows serving
as the means of delivery.

136
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:35,406
Stewardess Edith is played
by Norma McCarty.

137
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:42,455
Norma married Ed in 1955 shortly
after he broke up with Dolores Fuller.

138
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:46,750
She left him after only a few weeks...

139
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:52,840
...when she learned
he was a transvestite.

140
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:25,789
The actors found the dialogue in
the cockpit scenes to be so bad...

141
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:31,879
...that most of what ended up
in the film was improvised.

142
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:56,904
This footage of Bela
was most likely shot in 1955.

143
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:04,452
Bela is wearing a cape
he had previously worn...

144
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:07,540
...in a stage production of
"'Dracula."

145
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:14,879
The cape eventually became
the property of legendary...

146
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,970
...horror collector and historian
Forrest J. Ackerman.

147
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:15,668
Vampira was born Maila Syrjéniemi
on December 21, 1921.

148
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:19,672
Her professional name
is Maila Nurmi.

149
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:27,011
She never made
another film for Ed...

150
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:33,601
...but she did appear in
the 1998 film based on Ed's script...

151
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:36,689
..."I Woke Up Early The Day I Died."

152
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:44,028
She first came to national
attention on her local movie show...

153
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:50,119
..."The Vampira Show,"
a.k.a. "Movie Macabre."

154
00:32:51,078 --> 00:32:57,625
It was the cancellation
of that show...

155
00:32:57,626 --> 00:33:00,713
...that led to her accepting
a part in "Plan 9."

156
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:08,011
In the years following she did make
a few more appearances...

157
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:14,642
...in films such as
"The Magic Sword" (1962)...

158
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:20,733
...and "Sex Kittens
Go To College" (1960).

159
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:45,673
Vampira plays a "Vampire Girl"...

160
00:33:45,674 --> 00:33:51,764
...the resurrected wife
of Lugosi's character.

161
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:59,145
In "Ed Wood" she was portrayed
by actress Lisa Marie...

162
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:05,152
...who was director Tim Burton's
girlfriend at the time.

163
00:35:00,124 --> 00:35:06,213
The music in "Plan 9" was not
specifically written for the film.

164
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:13,761
Like stock footage Ed made
extensive use of library music...

165
00:35:13,762 --> 00:35:20,143
...for which he would only
have to pay a nominal fee...

166
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:26,233
...compared to the greater cost
of paying a composer for new music.

167
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:36,219
Joanna Lee's early career
acting in B-movies such as...

168
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:42,850
"The Brain Eaters" (1958)
and "Plan 9" (as Tanna)...

169
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:49,273
...would not seem to indicate the
great success she would later enjoy...

170
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:55,863
...as a writer for TV shows such as
"My Three Sons," "The Flintstones"...

171
00:36:55,864 --> 00:37:01,954
..."Bewitched," "Gilligan's Island,"
and "The Waltons."

172
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:09,252
She was nominated for an Emmy
for the TV movie "Babe" (1975)...

173
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:15,676
...and a Director's Guild award for
"My Dad Can't Be Crazy... Can He?"...

174
00:37:15,843 --> 00:37:22,265
...and won a Humanitas Prize
for the 1987 TV movie...

175
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:28,355
..."The Kid Who Wouldn't Quit:
The Brad Silverman Story."

176
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:35,362
Joanna Lee passed away on
October 24, 2003.

177
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:52,004
Carl Anthony (Patrolman Larry)
was another of Ed's friends.

178
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:59,343
He played a lead role
in Ed's last mainstream film...

179
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:05,350
..."The Sinister Urge" (1960),
a film about the porn industry.

180
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:12,733
He would only appear
in one more film...

181
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:19,031
"Raw Force" (1982)
starring Cameron Mitchell.

182
00:38:28,332 --> 00:38:34,962
Conrad Brooks (Patrolman Jamie)
was born Conrad Biedrzycki

183
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:38,008
on January 3, 1931.

184
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:45,348
He first met Ed when he and his
brothers were visiting Hollywood...

185
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:51,438
...and Ed agreed to act as cameraman
in a short film for them.

186
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:58,986
This footage (some of the earliest
surviving Ed material)...

187
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:05,077
...was eventually released
on home video.

188
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:12,333
Brooks went on to appear
in six films for Ed...

189
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:18,799
...including "Glen or Glenda"
and "Bride of the Monster"...

190
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:25,097
as well as appearing in "Ed Wood"
and "I Woke Up Early The Day I Died."

191
00:39:25,973 --> 00:39:32,395
Beginning in the 1980s he began
appearing in countless sub-B movies...

192
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:39,026
...from "Curse of the Queerwolf" (1988)
and "Ghost Taxi" (1999)...

193
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:45,075
...to "Dr. Horror's Erotic
House of Idiots" (2003).

194
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:52,124
Brooks was himself portrayed
by actor Brent Hinkley in "Ed Wood."

195
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:09,576
Lyle Talbot was born
Lysle Henderson on February 8, 1902.

196
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:17,124
During a career that spanned
six decades he appeared...

197
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:23,215
...in over 200 films and
over 150 television shows.

198
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:30,554
He was best known to the
general public as Joe Randolph...

199
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:34,141
...the Nelsons' next-door neighbor...

200
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:40,232
...on "The Adventures
of Ozzie and Harriet."

201
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:47,613
He appeared in many
movie serials including...

202
00:41:47,614 --> 00:41:54,203
...both "Batman and Robin" (1949)
as Commissioner Gordon...

203
00:41:54,204 --> 00:42:00,252
...and "Atom Man vs. Superman" (1950)
as villain Lex Luthor.

204
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:07,550
He first worked with Ed in 1953
in both "Glen or Glenda"...

205
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:13,640
...and the TV pilot
"Crossroad Avenger."

206
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:20,689
He also appeared in Ed's 1954
noir picture "Jail Bait."

207
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:28,195
His last acting role
was a guest appearance...

208
00:42:28,196 --> 00:42:34,286
...on the sitcom "Newhart"
in January 1987.

209
00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:41,293
Talbot passed away on
March 2, 1996.

210
00:42:47,215 --> 00:42:53,679
Sightings of unknown aircraft
date as far back as 329 BC...

211
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,728
...when Alexander the Great's army
saw "two silver shields" in the sky.

212
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:07,234
Other historical events include
sightings in Japan in 1235...

213
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:13,325
...Nuremberg in 1561,
and Basel, Switzerland, in 1566.

214
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:20,332
The earliest sightings in the United States
date from the 1890s.

215
00:43:21,249 --> 00:43:27,671
The classic UFO era began in 1947
with Kenneth Arnold's sighting...

216
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:33,762
...of several objects in the sky
over Mount Rainier, Washington.

217
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:43,687
The UFO craze really took hold
in the U.S. in the 1950s...

218
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:49,778
...with countless movies books
and comics devoted to the subject.

219
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:57,284
Although the belief in alien aircraft
has dropped off since then...

220
00:43:57,285 --> 00:44:03,666
...recent polls still show that
a majority of people believe...

221
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:09,756
...that extraterrestrial aircraft
do in fact exist.

222
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:18,390
There have been many attempts to
contact extraterrestrials.

223
00:44:19,307 --> 00:44:25,729
One movement devoted to
such ideas is called SETI...

224
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:31,778
...Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence.

225
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:39,743
The basic assumption is that any
extraterrestrial life would attempt...

226
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:46,333
...to contact us and that any
such contact would be...

227
00:44:46,334 --> 00:44:49,421
...mutually beneficial.

228
00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:57,761
Among the early SETI experiments
were the efforts of Frank Drake...

229
00:44:57,762 --> 00:45:03,810
...at Cornell University in 1960
to contact alien life through radio.

230
00:45:05,312 --> 00:45:11,401
More recent attempts have included
the use of laser and optical devices.

231
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:18,741
To date, despite these many efforts,
no concrete evidence has surfaced...

232
00:45:18,742 --> 00:45:24,831
...to conclusively prove the existence
of extraterrestrial life.

233
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:21,864
Costume designer Richard Chaney
only costumed two other films:

234
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:27,954
The 1956 films "The Boss"
and "The Bold and the Brave."

235
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:34,961
He never designed again
after working on "Plan 9."

236
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:43,946
The makeup for "Plan 9" was partly
the work of Harry Thomas...

237
00:48:43,947 --> 00:48:50,577
...whose career ran from 1936 until
1975 and spanned over 70 films...

238
00:48:50,578 --> 00:48:57,000
...including "Superman
and the Mole Men" (1951)...

239
00:48:57,001 --> 00:49:03,007
..."The Ten Commandments" (1956),
and "Little Shop of Horrors" (1960).

240
00:49:03,925 --> 00:49:10,390
He also worked for Ed on
"Glen or Glenda," "Jail Bait"...

241
00:49:10,598 --> 00:49:13,685
...and "Night of the Ghouls."

242
00:49:14,602 --> 00:49:20,692
He was portrayed by journeyman actor
Bob Leonard Termo in "Ed Wood."

243
00:49:21,568 --> 00:49:27,699
Thomas passed away on
October 21, 1996.

244
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:40,747
"Plan 9" Cinematographer
William C. Thompson...

245
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:47,212
...worked on all of Ed's films
from "Glen or Glenda" in 1953...

246
00:51:47,213 --> 00:51:50,757
...in which he also played a judge...

247
00:51:50,758 --> 00:51:56,848
...through "The Sinister Urge,"
Thompson's final film.

248
00:51:57,765 --> 00:52:04,146
Thompson shot over 60 films
in his career...

249
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:10,777
...including non-Ed B-pictures
like "Racket Girls" (1951)...

250
00:52:10,778 --> 00:52:16,868
...and Stephen Apostolof's
"Journey to Freedom" (1957).

251
00:52:17,785 --> 00:52:23,875
In "Ed Wood" Thompson was portrayed
by character actor Norman Alden.

252
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:30,882
Thompson passed away on
October 22, 1963.

253
00:53:15,843 --> 00:53:21,933
This is the last snippet of Lugosi
footage that appears in "Plan 9."

254
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,970
Paul Marco, an old friend of Ed's,
plays Patrolman Kelton.

255
00:53:59,887 --> 00:54:06,268
Due to the appearance of Kelton,
"Plan 9" serves as a kind of sequel...

256
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:12,358
...to Ed's previous film,
"Bride of the Monster."

257
00:54:13,276 --> 00:54:19,906
This connection is more explicit in
"Night of the Ghouls" when Kelton...

258
00:54:19,907 --> 00:54:25,997
...talks about dealing with "monsters,"
"space people," and "mad doctors."

259
00:54:26,914 --> 00:54:33,336
The "Kelton Trilogy" were the only
films Marco appeared in for Ed...

260
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:39,926
...although he would continue
to portray Kelton in public...

261
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:43,014
...for many years.

262
00:54:51,939 --> 00:54:55,942
Watch Dr. Mason's cape.
In a moment...

263
00:54:55,943 --> 00:55:01,991
...it will start to fall off but Mason
will catch it and pull it back on.

264
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,996
There it goes.

265
00:55:07,914 --> 00:55:14,336
Ed did not believe in doing a second
take unless the first one...

266
00:55:14,337 --> 00:55:20,426
...was completely unusable.

267
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:58,421
In 2005 Marco appeared as Kelton
in two independent films:

268
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:04,470
"The Naked Monster"
and "Kelton's Dark Corner."

269
00:56:05,972 --> 00:56:12,394
In "Ed Wood" Marco was
portrayed by Max Casella...

270
00:56:12,395 --> 00:56:15,481
...of "Doogie Howser" fame.

271
00:58:19,522 --> 00:58:25,945
"Plan 9" was shot in a small
facility called Quality Studios...

272
00:58:26,112 --> 00:58:33,118
...located on Santa Monica Blvd.
Next to the Harvey Hotel.

273
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:39,541
In the years since "Plan 9" was made
it has changed hands several times...

274
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:47,173
...serving in various capacities
for its different owners.

275
00:58:47,174 --> 00:58:50,261
It is still standing today.

276
00:59:33,596 --> 00:59:40,185
Ed Wood was born
Edward Davis Wood Jr...

277
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:46,275
on October 10, 1924,
in Poughkeepsie, New York.

278
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:53,324
He lived there until 1942,
when he enlisted in the Marines.

279
00:59:54,241 --> 01:00:00,331
He served in the South Pacific,
seeing action in several battles.

280
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,714
He was one of only about 400
U.S. survivors of the 40,00 troops...

281
01:00:09,715 --> 01:00:14,260
...who invaded the Tarawa islands
in November 1943.

282
01:00:14,261 --> 01:00:20,351
Upon returning from the war
Ed studied film under the G.I. Bill.

283
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:28,274
He then made his way
to Hollywood around 1947...

284
01:00:28,275 --> 01:00:31,362
...hoping to break
into the movies.

285
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:07,689
He first worked in Hollywood
for Universal Studios...

286
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:13,779
...as a "production assistant"
on many B-grade films.

287
01:01:14,738 --> 01:01:20,828
It was there that Ed first met
actors such as Lyle Talbot.

288
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:28,334
His first professional work was for
a production company he founded...

289
01:01:28,335 --> 01:01:34,425
...with Crawford John Thomas
to make TV commercials.

290
01:01:35,342 --> 01:01:41,432
Ed produced over 150 commercials,
according to his 1950s résumé.

291
01:01:42,349 --> 01:01:48,439
Ed's first feature film was 1953's
"Glen or Glenda."

292
01:01:49,356 --> 01:01:55,820
He followed that in 1954 with
the noir-style crime drama "Jail Bait"...

293
01:01:55,821 --> 01:02:01,827
that introduced future "Hercules"
actor Steve Reeves.

294
01:02:10,377 --> 01:02:16,799
After "Plan 9" Ed directed
only one more feature:

295
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:23,389
1960's "The Sinister Urge,"
although he would also direct...

296
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:29,480
...a few nudie and adult films
in the late '60s/early '70s.

297
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:37,403
The last film Ed directed was
the 1971 porn film "Necromania"...

298
01:02:37,404 --> 01:02:43,826
a tale of two young lovers
with sex problems...

299
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:50,416
...played by real-life couple
Ric Lutze and Rene Bond...

300
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:56,507
...who seek the help of
a sorceress to relieve their troubles.

301
01:02:57,883 --> 01:03:03,889
Most of Ed's output post:
"Plan 9" was as a screenwriter.

302
01:03:04,807 --> 01:03:11,437
He wrote or co-wrote
over half a dozen movies...

303
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:17,819
...for exploitation director
Stephen Apostolof...

304
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:23,909
...and several more
for other directors.

305
01:03:24,868 --> 01:03:31,457
Ed also acted throughout
those years...

306
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:37,880
...appearing in small
parts for Apostolof...

307
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:43,469
...as well as starring in
the 1969 comic nudie film...

308
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:49,560
"The Love Feast,"
a.k.a. "Pretty Models All In A Row."

309
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:25,887
Ed wrote several "adult" novels
to pay the bills in the '60s and '70s.

310
01:04:25,888 --> 01:04:29,515
These included titles such as:

311
01:04:29,516 --> 01:04:35,938
"Black Lace Drag,"
a.k.a. "Killer In Drag,."

312
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:42,528
"Death of a Transvestite,"
a.k.a. "Let Me Die In Drag,."

313
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:48,951
"Devil Girls," "Hell Chicks,"
"Security Risk"...

314
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:55,583
...as well as two novels on
the Watts uprisings:

315
01:04:55,584 --> 01:05:01,632
'Watts... The Difference"
and 'Watts..After."

316
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:42,588
Among Ed's last commissioned work
was a script for director...

317
01:05:42,589 --> 01:05:48,679
...Fred Olen Ray entitled
"Beach Blanket Bloodbath."

318
01:05:49,596 --> 01:05:56,018
The script was never completed
but Ray shot some footage...

319
01:05:56,019 --> 01:06:02,025
...based on the material on the set
of his 1988 film "Star Slammer."

320
01:06:39,021 --> 01:06:45,651
Ed and Kathy Wood were evicted
from their apartment in 1978...

321
01:06:45,652 --> 01:06:48,739
...and went to live with actor
Peter Coe.

322
01:06:49,656 --> 01:06:56,078
It was while staying there that
Edward D. Wood Jr. passed away...

323
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:02,085
...on December 10, 1978,
at age 54.

324
01:08:24,126 --> 01:08:30,215
Since its release "Plan 9"
as shown up all over the world.

325
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:34,719
Some of its alternate titles are:

326
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:41,767
"Plan 9 Aus Dem Weltall" (Germany)
i.e. "Plan 9 From The Universe"...

327
01:08:41,768 --> 01:08:48,774
..."Vampiros del Espacio" (Argentina)
i.e. "Vampires from Space"...

328
01:08:48,775 --> 01:08:55,781
..."Espectros del Espacio" (Brazil)
i.e. "Spectres from Space"...

329
01:08:55,782 --> 01:09:01,872
..."Plano 9 do Vampiro Zombie" (Portugal)
i.e. "Plan 9 of the Zombie Vampire."

330
01:10:01,848 --> 01:10:08,270
In the 1980s "Plan 9" served as
the basis for a musical called...

331
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:14,361
...appropriately enough
"Plan Nine: The Musical."

332
01:10:15,862 --> 01:10:22,284
It added a great deal
of intentional humor...

333
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:28,375
...and sexual innuendo
not found in the original.

334
01:10:31,878 --> 01:10:38,300
In 1990 Malibu Comics published
a comic book adaptation of "Plan"

335
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:44,890
while Eternity comics put out
an "official" sequel a year later:

336
01:10:44,891 --> 01:10:50,981
"Plan 9 From Outer Space:
Thirty Years Later."

337
01:10:51,898 --> 01:10:57,988
In 1990 Malibu also published
the screenplay to "Plan 9."

338
01:10:58,905 --> 01:11:04,995
It was sold as being
"Original Uncensored and Uncut."

339
01:11:05,912 --> 01:11:12,002
It was edited by Tom Mason
and most likely based on his copy.

340
01:12:01,968 --> 01:12:08,349
In 1993 a pornographic parody
of "Plan 9" was produced entitled...

341
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:11,436
..."Plan 69 From Outer Space."

342
01:12:12,979 --> 01:12:19,401
Although it does not follow
the same plot as "Plan"

343
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:22,447
it has many similarities.

344
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:30,412
These include scenes set in an
unconvincing cockpit on a patio...

345
01:12:30,413 --> 01:12:33,500
...and in a woman's bedroom.

346
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:41,423
The aliens fly a spaceship that looks
suspiciously like a paper plate...

347
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:47,514
...and are reviving the dead
for their own nefarious plans.

348
01:12:49,015 --> 01:12:55,437
It was followed by a remake
of "Glen or Glenda" entitled...

349
01:12:55,438 --> 01:13:02,027
..."Glen and Glenda" which adhered
more closely to the originals plot...

350
01:13:02,028 --> 01:13:08,118
...even to the point of using Ed's
own dialogue in several scenes.

351
01:13:38,064 --> 01:13:44,486
In 2005 a video game called
"Destroy All Humans!" was released...

352
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:50,577
...that featured unlockable footage
from "Plan 9 From Outer Space."

353
01:14:30,116 --> 01:14:36,538
In 1981 "Plan 9" was named
'Worst Film of All Time"...

354
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:42,629
...in the book
"The Golden Turkey Awards."

355
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:50,220
"In the same book Ed was named
'Worst Director of All Time."

356
01:14:51,137 --> 01:14:57,559
Despite these "awards"
(or perhaps because of them)...

357
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:03,608
...Ed's popularity has only
grown over the years.

358
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:11,532
His films see regular release
on home video and DVD...

359
01:15:11,533 --> 01:15:18,163
...there are film festivals
dedicated to his work...

360
01:15:18,164 --> 01:15:24,545
...and his life has been
documented on shows such as...

361
01:15:24,546 --> 01:15:31,176
"The Incredibly Strange
Film Show" (in 1989)...

362
01:15:31,177 --> 01:15:37,599
..."Mysteries and Scandals"
(in 1999)...

363
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:43,648
...and in the film "Ed Wood" where
he was played by Johnny Depp.

364
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:50,697
"Ed Wood" was a box office failure
but won two Academy Awards:

365
01:15:51,614 --> 01:15:55,617
The first for makeup...

366
01:15:55,618 --> 01:16:01,708
...the second for Martin Landau 's
portrayal of Bela.

367
01:16:59,641 --> 01:17:04,603
Memorabilia from Ed's movies
regularly runs to hundreds...

368
01:17:04,604 --> 01:17:07,690
...(if not thousands) of dollars.

369
01:17:09,275 --> 01:17:15,365
Even his cheap sleazy novels have
become valuable collector's items.

370
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:28,669
With Ed's filmography being regularly
revisited (particularly "Plan 9")...

371
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:36,301
...he and his films continue
to garner new fans year after year.

372
01:17:36,302 --> 01:17:42,308
His legacy seems assured and his work
will likely never be forgotten.
