# Pirate's Dilemma

This task was time-consuming and tricky, but I’m happy with how it turned out. I used **`IMDbPY`** to get the IMDb ID and used the code provided in the documentation to find the hash and filesize. For web scraping, I used **`BeautifulSoup4`**. Even though there weren’t many resources to check if my code was right, it worked well with the test movie. I got a lot of help from YouTube and the documentation, and I checked out OpenSubtitles links for more ideas. After carefully following the steps, I finished the CLI using **`Click`**.
